# Experiment-4
# Aim
Study of Set in python.
# Theory
1. A set is a collection of unique elements. Set is unordered so indexing is not possible.It does not allow duplicates and elements are mutable, but set items must be immutable (numbers, strings, tuples).
2. Set is created by curley brackets {}.
3. One cannot use indexing in set it can be used in tuple and list only.
4. If one has given 1 and true in a set and if we print its set it will give either of the value.
5. Element can be added by using add. example- name_of_the_set.add(element_to_be_added).
6. Element can be removed by using remove. example-name_of_the_set.remove(element_to_be_removed).
7. Union of elements-The union of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are in either set or in both set. Symbol-|.
8. Intersection- The common elements to both the set is called intersection of set. Symbol-&.
9. Difference- The difference of two sets means the set of elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. Example: set6 - set7 (The elements present in set 6 but not in set 7). Symbol(-)
10. Dissimilar- It gives the elements which are not common elements to both the sets.Symbol(^).
11. Frozenset- A frozenset is an immutable (unchangeable) version of a set or fixed set in Python.
12. If we create a list, we can convet that list into set by creating another set. Syntax-set(Name_of_the_list).

# Algorithm of Question-1
1. Start.
2. To create a list of names.
3. To store the list in another set using set.
4. To print the set.
5. End.

# Algorithm of Question-2 
1. Start.
2. To create 3 sets of subjects.
3. To create another variable to store the intersection of the 3 sets.
4. To print the result of the variable.
5. End.

# Algorithm of Question-3
1. Start.
2. To create 2 sets of names.
3. To print the common names of both the sets.
4. To print the names of those who are only in one club. 
5. End.

# Algorithm of Question-4
1. Start.
2. To create the set of all students.
3. To crete the set of present students.
4. To print the names of absent students using difference.
5. End.

# Algorithm of Question-5 
1. Start.
2. To create a set of courses.
3. To remove a course from the set using discard.
4. To print the updated set of courses.
5. End.

# Conclusion 
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.It automatically removes duplicate values and supports set operations like union and intersection.Sets are useful for fast membership testing and eliminating repeated data.
