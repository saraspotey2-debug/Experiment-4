# Experiment-4
# Aim
Study of Set in python
# Theory
1. A set is a collection of unique elements. Set is unordered so indexing is not possible.
2. Set is created by curley brackets {}.
3. One cannot use indexing in set it can used in tuple and list only.
4. If one has given 1 and true in a set it and if we print its set it will give either of the value.
5. Element can be added by using add. example- name_of_the_set.add(element_to_be_added).
6. Element can be removed by using remove. example-name_of_the_set.remove(element_to_be_removed).
7. Union of elements-The union of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are in either set or in both set. Symbol-|.
8. Intersection- The common elements to both the set is called intersection of set. Symbol-&.
9. Difference- The difference of two sets means the set of elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. Example- set6-set7 (The elements present in set 6 but not in set 7).
10. Dissimilar- It gives the elements which are not common elements to both the sets.
